> OrderBook Features
> 1. Basic features of matching biding and asking orders;
> 2. Support three commands, [New, Cancel, Replace], examples provided in ./test/data/test.command;
> 3. Provide recover mechanism, system will recover state automatically, all events are persisted to disk sequential;
> 4. All key features are UT covered;

> TODO Features
> 1. Using a client thread to simulate network module, as most of them are too large, should be improved later;
> 2. Using MMAP to write file, enable batch mechanism;
> 3. Single node system is not with high availability, maybe we can take the raft-based solution to replicate the events;
> 4. If we will pursuit higher performance, we can use a new key [price, orderid] encoding solution.
